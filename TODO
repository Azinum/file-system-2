TODO LIST for fs2

In progress:
- Managing files by full (absolute/relative) path (for instance: -c /shared/file.txt, -v ./foo/bar/foobar/, -i ../file.txt)
- Optimise read/writing (for instance read from last block instead of traversing from start to end)
- Fix autocomplete of files (with coloring)
- Cleanup fs_write (write_data) if possible
- Allow disks to be very big without making the loading time any longer.
- Deallocate block if itâ€™s empty
- Modify folder list when deleting files (Move everything one step to the left)

Issues:
- There are no restrictions when naming files. This is a way to make files unreadable by naming them '.', '/' or similar

Complete:
- Remove duplicate FSFILE (already defined in fs2.h)
- Move error handling to seperate files
- Make changing directories more intuitive
- Prohibit deletion of folders that are not empty (can only contain self and parent directory files in it)
